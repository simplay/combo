# Combo

**Combo** is a demo collection of various graph-algorithms and data-structures written in Ruby. Currently it only shows a demo of a **BFS** ( Breadth First Search) and **DFS** ( Depth First Search) graph traversal. Currently, the starting vertex of the traversal is hardcoded (first vertex in graph's vertex-list). This will be user-specifiable soon. Information about the file format in order to define a graph can be found in the WIKI.

## Installation
Assuming you have successfully installed **ruby**, **rvm** and **ruby-gems** you only have to clone this repository, browse into its root directory and then simply run ````bundle````.

## Usage
In order to run this application, type ````./combo```` into your console prompt - while being in the application's root directory. This will run a demo of a DFS and BFS graph traversal, starting at the first vertex defined in the graph file. Currently this program prints the corresponding traversal paths into the console plus the structure of the specified graph.
